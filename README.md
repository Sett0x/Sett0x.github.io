# Portfolio with Tailwind

### [Original Repository](https://github.com/Sett0x/Portfolio-Tailwind)

- `npx tailwindcss -o build.css --minify` to minify css
- [Minify JS](https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier)


Problem deploying original repository with Github Pages solved minifying  the CSS and JS files and draging and dropping into another repo.

#### Steps to archive the  score of 100 in lighthouse
(mainly following the suggestions of lighthouse)

- Convert  all images to next-gen format (webp, svg, etc) to reduce the load, every kb counts!
- Ensure the accessibility with aria-label and headers order (h1, h2, h3, etc).
- Use a proper color palette (easy to read).
- Make sure there are no unused CSS rules or JavaScript code.
- Minify counts!.
